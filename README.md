# Movie-Recommendation-System

The Movie Recommendation System is designed to enhance user experience by suggesting five related movies when a user selects a particular movie. Leveraging content-based filtering or collaborative filtering techniques, the system identifies movies with similar attributes such as genre, actors, directors, and user ratings.
The Dataset is "TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset"

### The model is based on the bag of words ML/NLP technique in which each movie is converted into a vector and then when a user selects a movie he/she is recommended 5 most similar movies based on the cosine similarity of the vectors of those movies with the vector of selected movie.
